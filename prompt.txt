I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Forms and input tags in HTML","number":"7","start":0.0,"end":30.92,"text":" In this video, we will know what are forms and what is the input tag in the form.  Using a form is a very important element of some websites because through the form, you submit data from client to server.  These are the forms that you see on contact pages, Google forms or inquiry forms.  The date and time to go to the flight or railway ticket, all these details we put, they are also submitted through the HTML forms.  In the last video, very few people liked it, I will request you to like this video with high energy so that we can maintain high energy throughout the course."},{"title":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work","number":"1","start":493.52,"end":499.52,"text":" If I write here  Assume html  If I hit enter  Then it automatically  Gave me the opening and closing tag"},{"title":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work","number":"1","start":493.52,"end":499.52,"text":" If I write here  Assume html  If I hit enter  Then it automatically  Gave me the opening and closing tag"},{"title":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML","number":"5","start":419.04,"end":423.4,"text":" So what is this?  How does it work?  I will tell you.  So here you see,  we used table tag."},{"title":"Video, Audio & Media in HTML","number":"10","start":523.48,"end":528.48,"text":" Your likes.  All this will help me a lot.  To bring such free courses.  So this was about.  Audio and video tags."}]

"where is forms and input tag taught in this course"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
